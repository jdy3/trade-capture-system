# Enhancement: Advanced Trade Search System


enhancement(trade): Enhancement 1 - Multi-criteria search

- Used logger.debug for enhancement retrieval operations in service layer to reduce noise in production. Recommendation for all retrieval operations to use logger.debug and only business operations to use logger.info.

- Used "/search/counterparty/{variable}" rather than /search/{variable}" as it’s more descriptive, explicit, and extensible. The /search endpoint family might grow (for book, and date searches etc).

enhancement(trade): Enhancement 1 - Paginated filtering
